Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?" 10-15 Tries just to get it running
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do? It did catch errors mostly for pip install requirements although it struggled heavily to resolve them.
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team? At first not very similar as copilot had a ton of uncleared packages however as we went on we told copilot to use less packages as they caused a ton of errors.


log.txt:

We had to tell copilot to put all the python text into just __init__.py, but it originally didn't work.
Copilot detects vulnerabilities, like unvalidated URL redirection and hardcoded credentials.
It also used a lot of imports that are unknown to us, like Bcrypt.
Copilot prefers to write code very neatly but also shortly, and doesn't like to blabber much unlike ChatGPT.
Code broke within the shell.
It had given the wrong requirements for pip installation
Issue where requirements is not completely updated and is not 100% the same as the imports
Started hallucinating folders and python files that are not in the folder
Keeps going in circles
We removed SQLAlchemy and created a new code sample
For some time copilot just ignored the repository we had. 
Finally, the copilot gave us code (after forgetting the code to run the app), and it worked up to registration, where it forgot to create the user database.
